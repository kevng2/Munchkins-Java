We implemented the game Munchkin Zombies. Zombies is just another theme to the munchkin game and the rules itself are the same. We do have some rule variations due to the time constraint and man power it took for the project to complete. We have cut out the mojo cards and some monster cards that required other users to intervene. In the topic of intervening users, we have cut out some of the ability for other users to intervene on other players turns for example cast a curse card while they fight since that is a very dynamic aspect of Munchkin. We had the base line for player assistance when fighting but did not have enough time to apply it to the GUI. Practically the game will work as the first player to go will kick the door, meaning pick up a Door card. If it is a monster and they fight it, if they do not have enough power level to defeat the monster, they will face the consequences the monster has. Else they will advance to up a level or two and pick up the treasure cards that the monster gives when it dies. These Treasure cards can be seperated by power ups, accessories or level up cards. The power up cards temporarily increase the power level of the munchkin. The Accessory card gives more power to the munchkin. The Free level card automatically allows the munchkin to go up a level. Once the Munchkin reaches level 10 they win.
